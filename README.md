# Florea Mihai's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the codebase behind my personal website — a digital space where I document my work, share insights, and showcase projects.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This site serves as both a portfolio and a lightweight blog. It’s designed to be fast, accessible, and minimal — with just enough personality to reflect how I think and work.

Everything is statically rendered for speed and simplicity, and the layout adapts seamlessly across devices.

---

## 🧱 Built With

The stack is intentionally lean:

- **React** – for building UI components with structure and flexibility  
- **Vite** – because fast builds and instant dev feedback are non-negotiable  
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling without the overhead of naming things  

It's modular, easy to extend, and deploys like a breeze.

## 🛠️ Key Features

This site is built with performance, clarity, and scalability in mind. A few things worth highlighting:

- Clean, modern UI with accessible design choices baked in  
- Modular component structure for easier maintenance and extension  
- Blazing-fast load times thanks to Vite’s optimized build process
